  Task: Are the numbers in order?
  Description:
    In this Kata, your function receives an array of positive integers as input.
    Your task is to determine whether the numbers are in ascending order.
    For the purposes of this Kata, you may assume that all inputs are valid (i.e. arrays containing only positive integers with a length of at least 2).

    //SOLUTION

    // const inAscOrder = arr => arr.every((_, i) => i === 0 || arr[i] > arr[i - 1])

  Task: Building a calculator
  Description:
    Let's build a calculator.
    This is very basic Javascript kata.
    The test expects you to provide a Calculator object with the following methods:
    Calculator.add()
    Calculator.subtract()
    Calculator.multiply()
    Calculator.divide()
    Each method expects two arguments, so for instance:
    Calculator.add(1,4) should return 5.
    Only integers are expected to be passed in as arguments,
    and the divide method should return 'false' when trying the divide by zero.

    //SOLUTION
      const Calculator = {
  add: (x, y) => x + y,
  subtract: (x, y) => x - y,
  multiply: (x, y) => x * y,
  divide: (x, y) => (y === 0 ? false : x / y),

    You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items.
    We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.
    Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item.
  Examples:
    It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

    likes ["Peter"] // must be "Peter likes this"
    likes ["Jacob", "Alex"] // must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
    likes ["Max", "John", "Mark"] // must be "Max, John and Mark like this"

     Unfortunately, Santa's Javascript and CoffeeScript Elves accidentally mixed the Naughty and Nice list together!
     Santa needs your help to save Christmas!
     Save Christmas!
       Santa needs you to write two functions, getNiceNames and getNaughtyNames.
       Both of the functions accept an array of objects. getNiceNames returns an array containing only the names of the nice people, and getNaughtyNames returns an array containing only the names of the naughty people
       Return an empty array [] if the result from either of the functions contains no names.
       The objects in the passed in array will represent people. Each object contains two properties: name and wasNice.
       name - The name of the person
       wasNice - True if the person was nice this year, false if they were naughty
     Person Object Examples
       { name: 'Warrior reading this kata', wasNice: true }
